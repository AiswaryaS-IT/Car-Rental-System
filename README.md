# Car Rental System
## Project Overview
This Car Rental System is a fully functional C-based console application that allows users to rent cars and manage their rentals. Developed during my first year of college, this project marks my first step into programming and problem-solving. Now, as I enter my pre-final year (3rd year), this project represents my evolution as a developer, showcasing my early skills and passion for software development.

The system handles several features such as car selection, customer management, rental pricing, and more. It was designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, ensuring a smooth experience for both users and administrators.

## Features
- User-Friendly Interface: Command-line interface for easy interaction.
- Car Selection: View available cars and select a vehicle for rent.
- Customer Management: Store and manage customer details.
- Rental Calculation: Calculate the rental price based on duration and type of vehicle.
- Data Persistence: File handling for storing and retrieving data about cars and customers.

## Technology Stack
- Language: C
- Development Environment: Turbo C
- File Handling: Used for data persistence of car information and rental history.

## Future Enhancements
- GUI Interface: Transition to a graphical user interface for a better experience.
- Database Integration: Use a database for better data handling.
- Dynamic Pricing: Implement real-time pricing updates based on car availability.
- Authentication: Introduce login/registration for secure access.

## Why This Project?
This project represents my initial approach to problem-solving and coding when I began my journey as a developer. Now in my pre-final year, I have learned more advanced concepts and developed multiple complex applications, but this project stands as a testament to my growth. Sharing it on GitHub highlights my continuous learning journey and my early hands-on experience in programming.
